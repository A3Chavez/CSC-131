Assumptions:
- List contains only whole positive integer values (i.e. i > 0)
- List is finite and unsorted
- List may contain duplicates
- List is not empty, at least 2 elements exist
- First and second element will be used for Max1 and Max2, respectively
	- Max1 is the largest value
	- Max2 is the second largest value
	- If Max1 = Max2 when initializing
		- This problem should fix itself if any element in the list satisfies the
		  Max1 or Max2 condition(s)
		- If still same when outputting results, same Max1 and Max2 values implies
		  there was only one maximum value in the List
- When looping:
	- Max1 condition is check first
	- Max2 condition(s) is/are check second
	- else: Max1 and Max2 not updated
- Must loop through List only one time
- Left to the reader to implement code
