Task:

Draw an activity diagram describing an algorithm for finding the top two maximum values in a list. The input is the list, and output is the top two maximum values.

Hints:

    Make your own assumptions
    Design/choose the algorithm first, then model it with an activity diagram
    Include appropriate level of detail in your model

How to draw your model:

Option 1: You may draw your model on paper, take a picture of it.

Option 2:  Use instructions provided in Announcement to use Visio, or Lucid Chart of Draw.io

Deliverable:

In a PDF file, include the algorithm (in pseudocode) you chose, the assumptions you made, and your model. Submit the PDF file in Canvas.
