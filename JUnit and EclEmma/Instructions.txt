 You may work collaboratively in a team and make only one submission. Only one student in your group need submit. Please mention (list) all your team member names in the submission comments box.

However, please make sure every student does the lab on their own laptop as well so that you practice thoroughly.

Students are allowed to submit individually as well. If you are submitting individually though you are part of a group please email me your attachment by Canvas email with clear information on the Subject line of the email.
